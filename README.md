CPE 322 Lab Project - Brandon Fox &amp; Nestor Sinchire

Needing secure access to my computer without having to have to type in a long password we will create a password protected system that will only unlock and allow a user access if they pass a facial recognition test.

This is for users who want secure protection without having to type out a long password or 2 step verifications. This can be fitted easily on a raspberry pi system.

Using a raspberry pi and webcam fitted with facial recognition software and machine learning capabilities. We can conduct a trial based study that lasts until the spring of 2024.

We expect this to be easily accessible after an initial face scan and can be used in any situation.

$30 for webcam
